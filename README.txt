Super simple extension that automatically redirects you to the archived version of a page for any domains you choose.
Useful for news sites that constantly badger you to subscribe or donate. Clicking the link takes you directly to the archived version (with a captcha)
Made this for my own personal use, you can install it by cloning the repo and loading it in your chrome browser

Note: archive.ph blocks traffic from some VPNs
